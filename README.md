# A.C.E - Accident Crash Emergency System ðŸš¨

## Overview

**A.C.E (Accident Crash Emergency System)** is an innovative, IoT-powered solution designed to detect road accidents in real-time using advanced technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. The system automatically alerts emergency services when an accident occurs, providing exact location data to ensure faster response times and potentially saving lives.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Accident Detection**: Utilizes IoT sensors and ML algorithms to continuously monitor roads, detecting accidents through visual cues and sensor data.
- **Immediate Alerts**: Automated notifications to emergency services via email or SMS, reducing delays in response times.
- **Precise Location Tracking**: Integrates with Google Maps API to provide the exact location of accidents for quick intervention.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Accessible through a responsive web and mobile interface for real-time monitoring and notifications.
- **Self-Learning Capabilities**: The system improves its detection accuracy over time by learning from new data, adapting to different accident scenarios.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily deployable in urban, rural, and remote areas, scalable for different applications including public events or large transportation networks.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: To gather real-time data from sensors (cameras, accelerometers, etc.).
- **Machine Learning & CNN**: For real-time pattern recognition and object detection.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For efficient accident detection from live video feeds.
- **Google Maps API**: For accident location tracking and emergency mapping.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: To build the front-end interface for user interaction.
- **SMTP & Google Requests API**: For sending automated alerts to authorities and emergency contacts.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: IoT sensors continuously gather data (visual, motion) to detect accidents using CNN and YOLO for object detection.
2. **Processing**: The system processes data in real-time, classifying incidents as accidents.
3. **Alerting**: Once an accident is detected, the system sends immediate alerts to emergency services, including exact GPS coordinates using Google Maps API.
4. **Response**: Emergency teams receive the alert and can navigate to the scene swiftly, reducing response time and improving outcomes.

## Installation

To get started with **A.C.E - Accident Crash Emergency System**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/garvkumar68/A.C.E.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd A.C.E
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure you have all necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, etc.).

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Google Maps API for location tracking.
   - SMTP for email notifications.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running:

- **Monitoring**: The system will continuously monitor traffic for accidents in real-time using connected IoT sensors.
- **Alerts**: On detection, it automatically sends email alerts with accident details and location to emergency services.
- **Dashboard**: Use the web interface to monitor the status, review data, and adjust system configurations.
